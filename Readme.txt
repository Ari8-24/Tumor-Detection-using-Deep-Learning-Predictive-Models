In a group project with 3 members, we focused on applying deep learning models like DNNs, CNNs, and ANNs for image classification, potentially in medical diagnostics involving brain tumors.

Key Components:

Problem Statement: Leveraging deep learning to enhance image classification accuracy, particularly in medical imaging.
Dataset: Used a labeled dataset ("yes"/"no") for effective model training.
EDA & Data Preprocessing: Employed data analysis, preprocessing, and augmentation techniques to prepare the dataset.
Model Building: Constructed various models, including transfer learning with VGG16, to improve classification performance.
Evaluation & Comparative Analysis: Evaluated models based on accuracy, balancing precision with computational efficiency.
Impact:

Medical Diagnostics: Aims to improve brain MRI image classification for earlier, more accurate diagnosis.
Research Contribution: Offers insights into the strengths and limitations of different neural network architectures.
Real-world Applicability: Demonstrates potential for clinical deployment, balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.
